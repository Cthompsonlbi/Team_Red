### Mockup Machine learning Model



### Mockup Database


### rudimentary EDA 



### Technologies we will use:

Python
Pandas
Sklearn
Tableau
Postgres SQL

### Machine Learning Model:

We decided to use a Supervised Learning Model, because our data has labeled input and output data.
It has a target column and features.
As a model we use a DecisionTree classifier and investigate further for class imbalances.
As a second validation we will be using a RandomForest classifier model.
