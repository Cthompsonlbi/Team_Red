### Topic of our Project

We analyze a Holiday package Dataset. The purpose of the analysis is to look at past events and use Data analysis and Machine learning to give business recommendations to our client on how to introduce a new vacation package.

#### Reason for selection: 

-	One of our team members is familiar with the industry and has a passion for analyzing this specific topic.
-	The Dataset is relevant to our questions, has enough data points and features and could be easily adapted to an industry dataset.
-	The Data seems at first glance to be quite clean.
-	It is publicly available and updated monthly. 

#### Questions we hope to answer:

Our client is introducing a new vacation package. He would like to answer at least one of these questions:

-	Can we predict how the ideal target customer would look like?
-	What would be a good marketing strategy?
-	What variables have the most influence on the purchase decision?

#### Mockup Machine learning Model

##### Machine Learning Model:
We decided to use a Supervised Learning Model, because our data has labeled input and output data.
It has a target column and features.
As a model we use a DecisionTree classifier and investigate further for class imbalances.
As a second validation we will be using a RandomForest classifier model.

A mockup of our Machine learning model can be found here:

#### Mockup Database

We use PG Admin as our Database.
We have seperated the Dataset into two tables a Customer table and a Marketing table.
The 2 Data
The 2 tables are connect throught he Customer ID.

Here is a preliminary ERD:
